# California Goldens

This is a website that I designed to practice HTML and CSS. I used flexbox to order the elements in the nav bar. I also used JavaScript to add event listeners to the nav bar elements.

### Home Page

There is an image with some descriptive text to the side.

### About Us

I used flexbox to style the three different columns of text. I also attached some links at the end of the texts. 

---

### Our Goldens

This page contains images of Golden Retrievers that have been sized to fit the webpage. 

---

### Puppies

I used the CSS to create an image overlay effect. The overlay slides from the left to display some text on hover. I gave the overlay an opacity of 0.8 so that the user can still see the image underneath.

### Contact Us

This page contains a form that allows the user to enter some data. However, the form is not sent anywhere on submit.
