            <p>
                California Goldens has been breeding <strong>Golden Retrievers</strong> since 1962. We are committed to the health and well-being of our dogs so we always put our dogs before everything else. It started as a small venture, but we are now fully committed to providing for our Goldens. Our initial location was in San Francisco but we have since moved to San Jose. Its been more than 50 years since we started, and it has now become a generational business. It brings us great joy to be able to breed our own puppies and match them up with loving families. Golden Retrievers are one of the most gentle breeds in the world.

            <p>
                We have been helping families find their perfect furry companions for more than 50 years now. Our first priority is to ensure that our puppies' forever homes provide a safe and nurturing environment. We ensure that our puppies are up to date on their vaccinations and dewormers. They are also crate trained, which makes it easier for them to adapt to their new homes. Upon adoption, we provide free crates, toys, food, bowls, leash and collars. Goldens are one of the most intelligent and gentle breeds so they are extremely family and kid friendly.

            <p>
                Currently there are 8 puppies up for adoption. We take them to the vet very often to make sure that they are upto date on their shots and check ups. They are 8-weeks old and very active. They have been going through a teething phase, which means nothing is safe from their bites. For now, they have the attention span of ten minutes before falling asleep again, but in those ten minutes, they are highly attentive and trainable. Upon adoption, please be sure to use the same food as what we use here in order to prevent any allergic reactions as puppies are extremely sensitive.
